            <h2 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2>

            <p>Community maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
            behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
            response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

            <p>Community maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
            reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
            that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
            permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
            threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

            <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

            <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
            reported by contacting the community team at <a href="mailto:hello@aeccollective.com">hello@aeccollective.com</a>. All
            complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
            is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The community team is
            obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
            Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
