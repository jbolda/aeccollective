[mastan2](http://www.mastan2.com/) | Open Source | MASTAN2 is an interactive structural analysis program that provides preprocessing, analysis, and postprocessing capabilities. The number of pre- and post-processing options, however, have been limited in order to minimize the amount of time needed for a user to become proficient at its use.
[SAP2000](https://www.csiamerica.com/products/sap2000) | Paid | From its 3D object based graphical modeling environment to the wide variety of analysis and design options completely integrated across one powerful user interface, SAP2000 has proven to be the most integrated, productive and practical general purpose structural program on the market today. This intuitive interface allows you to create structural models rapidly and intuitively without long learning curve delays.
[GT STRUDL](https://hexagonppm.com/products/analysis-product-family/gt-strudl) | Originally Academic, Now Corp | GT STRUDL includes all the tools necessary to analyze a broad range of structural engineering and finite element analysis problems, including linear and nonlinear static and dynamic analysis, and it can do so accurately in a fraction of the time of most other solutions. The new CAD modeler user interface has an AutoCAD-based environment that allows structural engineers to instantly see analysis and design results.
[TEDDS](https://www.tekla.com/products/tekla-tedds#) | Paid | Tekla Tedds is powerful software to automate your repetitive structural calculations. Choose from one or more of our regularly updated calculation libraries or write your own, and create professional documentation every time. Combine your structural calculations with 2D frame analysis. 
[Risa 3D](https://risa.com/p_risa3d.html) | Paid | User friendliness combined with advanced analysis capabilities make this industry standard software a very powerful tool for the analysis and optimization of all types of structures and all common structural materials, including steel, concrete, wood, aluminum and masonry. 
[OpenSees](http://opensees.berkeley.edu/) | Open Source - Academic | The Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) is a software framework for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems. OpenSees has advanced capabilities for modeling and analyzing the nonlinear response of systems using a wide range of material models, elements, and solution algorithms. The software is designed for parallel computing to allow scalable simulations on high-end computers or for parameter studies.
