From shear walls and retaining walls to precast, ICF, and tilt-up walls, engineers worldwide use spWall v5.01 to optimize complicated wall design, reinforcing, and deflections.

spWall, formerly pcaWall/PCA-Tilt/TILT, is a program for design and analysis of cast-in-place reinforced concrete walls, deep beams, coupling beams, tilt-up walls, ICF walls, and precast architectural and load-bearing panels.

Upgraded to ACI 318-14 and CSA A23.3-14, spWall's graphical interface easily generates complex wall models. Wall geometry (including any number of openings and stiffeners), material properties, loads (point, line, and area), and the support conditions are assigned graphically by the user. Also, springs (translational and rotational) can be graphically assigned at any node.

spWall uses a finite element solver and takes into account second-order effects. The wall may include any number of openings and stiffeners. The amount of steel required for flexure is computed based on the selected design standard, and the user can specify one or two layers of reinforcement.

The program calculates the required amount of reinforcement in the plate elements and stiffener elements based on the code selected by the user. For solid walls, spWall can also compare cross-sectional shear forces with calculated in-plane and out-of plane shear strength provided by concrete.

[spColumn](/software/spColumn/) complements spWall by generating axial/flexure (P-M) diagrams suitable for shear wall design.
