Mesh generation software from Pointwise and its co-founders has been used for CFD preprocessing on applications as diverse as aerodynamic performance of the F-35 Lightning II and reducing fish mortality rates in a hydroelectric project.

Pointwise is the choice for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) meshing, covering all aspects of preprocessing from geometry model import to flow solver export. Available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, you can generate structured, unstructured, and hybrid meshes including our anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion (T-Rex) technique for highly-automated generation of boundary layer resolving hybrid meshes.
