With newly introduced spResults and spReporter Modules and powered by the advanced and flexible graphical interface of new spSection Module for creating and modifying irregular sections, spColumn v6.00 is widely used for design and investigation of columns, shear walls, bridge piers as well as typical framing elements in buildings and other structures. Equipped with latest American (ACI 318-14) and Canadian (CSA A23.3-14) Concrete codes, spColumn is developed to design and investigate any reinforced concrete sections subject to combined axial and flexural loads. Formerly pcaColumn, PCACOL, and IrrCOL, spColumn investigates sections that are impossible to find on design charts or to do by hand. The section can be rectangular, round or irregular, with any reinforcement layout or pattern. The program offers investigation of irregularly shaped, reinforced concrete column sections that may contain openings or boundary elements. Top selling worldwide, spColumn provides a full featured 3D visualization of the nominal and factored failure surface. Import/export of DXF files, nominal interaction diagrams, and display of capacities at your load point are just a few of the rich program features.
