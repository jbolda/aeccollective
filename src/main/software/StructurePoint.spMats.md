Powered by a sophisticated FEM Solver increasing capacity and substantially speeding up solution for large and complex models, spMats v8.12 is widely used for analysis, design and investigation of concrete mat foundations, footings, and slabs on grade.

spMats, formerly pcaMats and MATS, is equipped with the latest American (ACI 318-14) and Canadian (CSA A23.3-14) concrete codes. spMats is utilized by engineers worldwide to optimize complicated foundation design,and improve analysis of soil structure interaction.

spMats uses the plate-bending theory and the Finite Element Method (FEM) to model the behavior of the mat or slab. The soil supporting the slab is assumed to behave as a set of one-way compression-only springs (Winkler foundation). The boundary conditions may be the underlying soil, nodal springs, piles, or translational and rotational nodal restraints. The model is analyzed under uniform (surface) and concentrated loads. The resulting deflections, soil pressure (or spring reactions), and bending moments are output.
