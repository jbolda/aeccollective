Code_Aster offers a full range of multiphysical analysis and modelling methods that go well beyond the standard functions of a thermomechanical calculation code: from seismic analysis to porous media via acoustics, fatigue, stochastic dynamics, etc. Its modelling, algorithms and solvers are constantly under construction to improve and complete them (1,200,000 lines of code, 200 operators). Resolutely open, it is linked, coupled and encapsulated in numerous ways.
