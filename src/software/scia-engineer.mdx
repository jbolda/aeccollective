SCIA Engineer is an integrated, multi-material structural analysis and design software for all kinds of structures. Its wide range of functionality makes it the ideal partner for the design of office buildings, industrial plants, bridges or any other project, all within the same easy-to-use environment.

 - Powerful CAD-like modeling, advanced types of calculation, code-compliant multi-material design and customizable reports.
 - Typical situations can be automated with built-in or user-defined parametric templates for various geometries and powerful load generation tools.
 - SCIA Engineer provides the most comprehensive implementation of Eurocodes, including National Annexes, U.S. codes and other international standards.
 - Seamless exchange of models with other project stakeholders, through the powerful bi-directional links with Revit and Tekla Structures, open file formats in Open BIM, or third-party plug-ins.
