spFrame, is a feature-rich structural analysis program for two- and three-dimensional structures subject to static loads. Used by academic and industry professionals, it offers a quick and straightforward analysis tool.

spFrame, formerly pcaFrame, has a fast and robust yet simple graphic interface that displays the modeled structure, the input loads, the deflected shape, and the resulting moment and shear diagrams. The graphic interface allows zooming, translating, rotating, and selective viewing of the graphical image.

With spFrame, engineers may view all output results in text or graphical formats before printing. Output includes: joint displacements and rotations, support reactions, member end forces and moments, segmental member results (at 100 locations per member), member summary, result envelopes, and diaphragm displacements.
