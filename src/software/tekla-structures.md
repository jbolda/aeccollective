# Tekla Structures BIM software
_They constantly test and develop Tekla Structures and help you to get started with it._

Models created with Tekla BIM software carry the accurate, reliable and detailed information needed for successful Building Information Modeling and construction execution. Welcome smoother workflow to your company with Tekla Structures and constructible models.

Tekla works with all materials and the most complex structures – you set the limits. Our customers have used Tekla Structures to model stadiums, offshore structures, plants and factories, residential buildings, bridges and skyscrapers. 

## Help with implementation
Tekla staff and our resellers help with implementation of the software. We come close to our customers and offer local support and trainings. 

## Open approach to Building Information Modeling
Tekla is ready to use, but you can optimize it if you want. As Tekla has an open approach to BIM, you can run other providers’ solutions and fabrication machinery and still interface with Tekla. Extending and enhancing Tekla Structures is easy with Tekla Open API, the application interface.
