LUSAS Bridge is a world-leading finite element analysis software application for the analysis, design and assessment of all types of bridge structures. 

Whether you need to carry out a straightforward linear static analysis of a single span road bridge, a dynamic analysis of a slender architectural steel movable footbridge, or a detailed geometrically nonlinear staged erection analysis of a major cable stayed structure involving concrete creep and shrinkage, LUSAS Bridge provides all the facilities you need. 

Extensive results processing, viewing and report generation facilities give you ultimate control over what you plot and print from your analysis. In short, LUSAS Bridge software handles simple grid/grillage and slab structures with ease and has a full range of additional software options and features for more advanced bridge structures.
