This is th source code for the [AEC Collective](https://www.aeccollective.com).

The AEC Collective is a community for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction. It is uses the Discord program which is a free voice, video and text chat app that you can access via PC, browser, or mobile phone. We look to help mentor those just starting in the industry, and provide a great place for networking with your peers around the world. We can all benefit from understanding each related niche better, but also understanding our own niche outside of our geographic region.

Please visit the website to join the community.
